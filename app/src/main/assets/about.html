                <strong>We started the company in 2005 with the belief that mobile-phones would be
                    the globes preferred communication tool. Today there are more mobile devices
                    than cars, credit cards, televisions or even personal computers stating that our
                    vision has come true.</strong>

                    the world’s leading companies to conceive, design, engineer, and launch products
                    and services that are meaningful and beneficial. We have 10 years of experience

                    and become major services in high-populated markets such as India and Malaysia,

                    innovative angle. A few years later we have completed hundreds of mobile
